## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination
- Publishing others’ private information without permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards
and will take appropriate action in response to any behavior they deem
inappropriate, threatening, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code applies in all community spaces and also when an individual is
officially representing the community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders at  
**[maintainer@lobbyleaks.com](mailto:maintainer@lobbyleaks.com)**.  
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and safety of the
reporter of any incident.
