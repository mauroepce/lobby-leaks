## 💬 Where to talk

We use [GitHub Discussions](../../discussions) as the main hub for community interaction.  
Please choose the right category for your post:

- [**Announcements**](../../discussions/categories/announcements)  
  Official updates from maintainers (releases, roadmap changes).  
  🔒 Read-only for community; only maintainers can start threads here.

- [**Q&A**](../../discussions/categories/q-a)  
  Ask and answer technical questions. Mark accepted answers to help future readers.

- [**Ideas**](../../discussions/categories/ideas)  
  Propose features, integrations, or improvements.  
  👉 Polls are enabled here so the community can vote on priorities.  
  ⚠️ Note: polls are for **informal feedback only**. Maintainers make final calls based on scope and roadmap.
